Built a fully responsive e-commerce website for a cosmetics company, utilizing Shopify as the content management system and accessing content through GraphQL APIs. I've implemented various features such as authentication, Google Analytics, order tracking, and payment processing by integrating a third-party API, specifically Stripe.
