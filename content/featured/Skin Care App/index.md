Developed and delivered high-quality iOS and Android mobile applications for the skin care industry. I've implemented advanced features such as Haut.ai and Twilio API integration, Async Storage, Google Analytics, and Push Notifications. Additionally, I stored data on Firebase Realtime Database and managed customer data on Shopify using GraphQL API.
